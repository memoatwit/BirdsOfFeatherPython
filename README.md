Machine Learning Based Heuristic Search Algorithms to Solve Birds of a Feather Card Game. Bryon Kucharski, Azad Deihim, and Mehmet Ergezer. The Ninth Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-19). Honolulu, Hawaii.

## Birds Of a Feather
A research challenge based on a solitaire-type game called [Birds of a Feather](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/puzzles/boaf/birds-of-a-feather-challenge.pdf) developed by [Professor Todd Neller](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/).

## Abstract
This research was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of two undergraduate students and a faculty to explore solutions to the Birds of a Feather (BoF) Research Challenge. BoF is a newly-designed perfect-information solitaire-type game. The focus of the study was to design and implement different algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness. The team compared the provided depth-first search (DFS) to heuristic algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), as well as a novel heuristic search algorithm guided by machine learning. Since all of the studied algorithms converge to a solution from a solvable deal, effectiveness of each approach was measured by how quickly a solution was reached, and how many nodes were traversed until a solution was reached. The employed methods have a potential to provide artificial intelligence enthusiasts with a better understanding of BoF and novel ways to solve perfect-information games and puzzles in general. The results indicate that the proposed heuristic search algorithms guided by machine learning provide a significant improvement in terms of number of nodes traversed over the provided DFS algorithm.
